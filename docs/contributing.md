## Getting Started: Set Up a Local Development Environment (kind)

### Prerequisites

- A container runtime (docker, podman, etc.)
- Git
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)
- [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
- [`yq`](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)
- `make`

To run an instance of Burrito, you will need a Kubernetes cluster. This tutorial uses Kind as a local development Kubernetes cluster.

Follow [Kind's quick start tutorial](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start) to set up a local cluster.

Once your cluster is up and running, follow the next steps to compile and deploy Burrito.

### Basic Install

Follow these steps to install a minimal working configuration of Burrito on a Kind cluster:

- Cert-manager
- Burrito controllers in the `burrito-system` namespace
- A datastore running with mock storage (in-memory)
- A `TerraformRepository` and an associated `TerraformLayer` resource in the `burrito-project` namespace, pointing to the [padok-team/burrito-examples](https://github.com/padok-team/burrito-examples) repository

*Before starting, check that your local Kind cluster is running and that your context is set to target this cluster*

1. **Install cert-manager on your cluster:**
```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm upgrade --install -n cert-manager --create-namespace cert-manager bitnami/cert-manager --set installCRDs=true
```
2. **Fork and clone this repository.**

3. **Run the following command to build a local image of Burrito, load it into your Kind cluster, and install Burrito with development Helm values:**
    
    ```bash
    make upgrade-dev-kind
    ```

4. **Check that Burrito is running in the `burrito-system` namespace:**
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n burrito-system
    ```

    The output should be similar to:

    ```bash
    NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    burrito-controllers-7657b7455-2ldtd   1/1     Running   0          5m32s
    burrito-datastore-5967f46497-tfzgg    1/1     Running   0          5m32s
    burrito-server-5b6fb78949-ngcnt       1/1     Running   0          5m32s
    ```

5. **Create layers and repository resources:**

    Create a `dev` directory in `deploy/charts/burrito/templates/` and add a `dev.yaml` manifest with development resources:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: config.terraform.padok.cloud/v1alpha1
    kind: TerraformLayer
    metadata:
        name: my-layer
        namespace: burrito-project
    spec:
        branch: main
        path: terraform/
        repository:
            name: my-repository
            namespace: burrito-project
    ---
    apiVersion: config.terraform.padok.cloud/v1alpha1
    kind: TerraformRepository
    metadata:
        name: my-repository
        namespace: burrito-project
    spec:
        repository:
            url: https://github.com/padok-team/burrito-examples
        remediationStrategy:
            autoApply: true
        terraform:
            enabled: true
        opentofu:
            enabled: false
        terragrunt:
            enabled: false
    ```

6. **Refresh your Helm configuration:**

    ```bash
    make upgrade-dev-helm
    ```

7. **Check that a runner pod is created for the newly created layer:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n burrito-project
    ```

    The output should be similar to:

    ```
    NAME                   READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
    my-layer-apply-gxjhd   0/1     Completed   0          2m36s
    ```

### Refresh Commands

To build a new local image of Burrito, push it into your local Kind cluster, and update the Helm release with the new image tag, run the following:

```bash
make upgrade-dev-kind
```

To refresh the Helm chart with development values, run:

```bash
make upgrade-dev-helm
```

Check the [Makefile](https://github.com/padok-team/burrito/blob/main/Makefile) for more details about these commands.

### Advanced Settings

**Configure a GitHub Token for TENV**

It is strongly recommended to create a GitHub token with no specific rights to bypass the GitHub API rate limiting. Append the following configuration to your development `TerraformRepository` resources:

```yaml
  overrideRunnerSpec:
    env:
      - name: TENV_GITHUB_TOKEN
        value: ghp_xxxxx
```

## Development Guidelines

### Testing

- Write tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Run all tests to ensure existing functionality isn't broken (`make test`).
- Ensure code coverage remains at the same level or higher.

### Commit Messages

- Please follow the convention described by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- If you don't, the CI pipeline will fail.
