**Burrito** is a TACoS (**T**erraform **A**utomation **Co**llaboration **S**oftware) Kubernetes Operator.

## Why does this exist?

[`terraform`](https://www.terraform.io/) is a tremendous tool to manage your infrastructure in IaC.
However, it lacks built-in solutions for managing [state drift](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/state/resource-drift).

Additionally, configuring a CI/CD pipeline for Terraform can be challenging and often varies depending on the selected tools.

Finally, currently, there is no easy way to navigate your Terraform state to truly understand the modifications it undergoes when running `terraform apply`.

`burrito` aims to tackle those issues by:

- Planning continuously your Terraform code and running applies if needed
- Offering an out-of-the-box PR/MR integration so you do not have to write CI/CD pipelines for Terraform ever again
- Showing your state's modifications in a simple Web UI
